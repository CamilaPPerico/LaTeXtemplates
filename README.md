# LaTeXtemplates

## Using templates
Usually my templates are not much complexes. If you are a Tux, just tap on prompt:
```bash
pdflatex file.tex
```
And if you are a windows or mac user, you may use the compiler from your own editor. 

For begginers, is interesting to start with the online plataform Overleaf.
